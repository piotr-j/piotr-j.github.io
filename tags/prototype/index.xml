      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project R is was an university game project I did during my exchange in Spain. The game is written in Java and uses LibGDX  as its main framework. Another important part is Spine , advanced tool for 2D animation. The game features three heroes with various abilities. The goal is to reach to lowest possible level of the dungeon. To do that player has to defeat the monsters and other obstacles. Its optimized for touch input. Some of the art was created by  Dariusz T.&lt;/p&gt;
