My name is Piotr Jastrzębski, I'm a graduate of [Lublin University of Technology](http://en.pollub.pl/) in Computer Science with speciality in Software Development Technologies. 

Past few years I've been focusing on Unreal Engine and more recently Godot Engine. Both are fun!

I've also worked in Java with focus on LibGDX framework. Touched Spring, made some apps in Python too.

Some of my work is open source and you can check it out at [Github](github.com/piotr-j/).
