My name is Piotr Jastrzębski, I'm a graduate of [Lublin University of Technology](http://en.pollub.pl/) in Computer Science with speciality in Software Development Technologies. Currently I focus on making games in Unreal Engine and Godot.

I've also worked in Java with focus on LibGDX framework. Touched Spring, made some app in Python too

Some of my work is open source and you can check it out at [Github](github.com/piotr-j/).
