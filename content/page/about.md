My name is Piotr JastrzÄ™bski, I'm a graduate of [Lublin University of Technology](http://en.pollub.pl/) in Computer Science with speciality in Software Development Technologies. Currently I focus on making games and tools in Java.

I've found Java to be most usefull in cross-platform development. I've used it mainly for games with the LibGDX framework and for Android apps. 
I also have some experience in Python, I've created many cli scripts and some GUI applications with PyQT and WxPython. 

Besdides that I've worked with various technologies such as C/C++, C#, Haskell, Excel VBA, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby and many others. I'm a generalist.

Some of my work is open source and you can check it out at [Github](github.com/piotr-j/).
