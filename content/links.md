I currently work on a couple of projects...

Dart Racer
---------------

My solo dev adventure, hybrid flat and vr arcade racing game. Some help here and there from freelancers.

Wishlist on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2401910/Dart_Racer/)!
Buy EA on [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/dart-racer/6918614874833696/)!

Perhaps more platforms in the future?

Cozy hidden object puzzle adventure game. I'm a programmer, my fiancé is doing pretty much everything else.
