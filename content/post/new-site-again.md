Last site attempt somewhat failed, mainly due it being a PITA to update. 

These days it is a lot easier with all that free CPU seconds available!

Stack is pretty much what it was before, HUGO and GitHub Pages for hosting. 
The new part is GitHub Actions so site is automatically build on push to repo.
That makes the annoying part automatic. Perhaps it will be pleasant enough to post something from time ot time!
