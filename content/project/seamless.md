Seamless was my entry for Ludum Dare 27. Seamless is a simple 2D platformer. As with my other games it is written in Java and uses LibGDX  as its main framework. Character animation is made with Spine . Collision handling is achieved with Box2D . The main goal is to get to next chamber before the 10 second timer runs out. The most aparant issue with the game are the controls. Turns out making Box2D character move in sensible way is quite challenging. You can find the source on [Github](https://github.com/piotr-j/LudumDare27).
