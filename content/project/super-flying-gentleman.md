Super Flying Gentlement is my first released game. It is heavily inspired by indie hit, Flappy Bird. I wanted to create something reasonable simple and fast. I vastly underestimated the time and effort required to created something more than a simple clone.

The game is written in Java and uses LibGDX  as its main framework. Another important part is Spine , advanced tool for 2D animation. Collision detection is achieved with Box2d. Web demo is powered by GWT.

You can get it right now on Get it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.piotrjastrzebski.sfg.android) for low price of free. There are some unobtrusive ads, but you can easly remove them with simple and cheap IAP.

You can play a web demo here! Requires WebGL. One more thing, it is open source! Check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/piotr-j/Super-Flying-Gentlemen).
